Step-by-Step Agentic AI Process for Crime Scene Video Analysis
 
An Agentic AI system can automate the entire workflow, with each "agent" or module handling a specific task and communicating its results to the next.
 
Step 1: Video Ingestion and Metadata Extraction Agent
 
This agent is responsible for receiving new video uploads and gathering initial information.
Action: When a new crime scene video is uploaded by a user, this agent immediately begins processing.
Information Extraction: It extracts essential metadata:
Upload Timestamp: Date and time the video was uploaded.
Geographical Location (GPS): If available from the video file or user input.
Video Duration: Length of the video.
Video Hash/Fingerprint: Generate a unique identifier for the video content itself (e.g., perceptual hash or a more robust content-based fingerprint).
Storage: Stores the video temporarily in a designated staging area (e.g., cloud storage bucket) and its metadata in a database.
Hand-off: Passes the video's metadata (location, time, duration, and hash) to the Duplicate Detection Agent.
 
Step 2: Duplicate Detection Agent
 
This agent's primary role is to identify and flag redundant video uploads.
Action: Receives metadata from the Video Ingestion Agent.
Candidate Collection: It queries the metadata database to find other videos uploaded:
Within a defined geographic radius (e.g., 500 meters to 1 mile) of the new video's location.
Within a defined time window (e.g., Â±2 hours) of the new video's upload timestamp.
Near-Duplicate Analysis: For the collected candidates, it performs a comparison:
Hash/Fingerprint Comparison: Uses the generated video hashes/fingerprints to identify exact or near-exact duplicates. Consider using techniques like video content hashing (e.g., dHash, pHash for video frames, or more advanced methods like SimHash for video segments) for robust detection beyond simple file hashes.
Metadata Validation: Double-checks location and time proximity.
Flagging Logic:
Groups all identified duplicate/near-duplicate videos.
Within each group, it flags all videos as "duplicate" except for the one with the longest duration. This longest video is marked as the "canonical" version for further processing.
Hand-off: Sends the status (original or duplicate) of the new video, along with its metadata, to the Video Classification Agent.
 
Step 3: Video Classification Agent
 
This agent analyzes the content of the "canonical" videos to determine their nature.
Action: Receives the "canonical" video (or a flag indicating it's the non-duplicate) and its path from the Duplicate Detection Agent.
Content Analysis: Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., a deep learning model trained on video data) to classify the video content into predefined categories. Examples include:
"Urgent Crime": Directly depicts a crime in progress, violence, or immediate danger (e.g., active shooter, assault, robbery).
"People/Crowd": Focuses primarily on individuals or groups, but not necessarily a crime (e.g., public gatherings, lost person, suspicious loitering).
"Vehicle/Traffic": Related to vehicles, accidents, or traffic violations.
"Property Damage": Shows vandalism or damage to property.
"Other/Informational": General footage that doesn't fit specific crime categories but might be relevant (e.g., an abandoned object).
Confidence Score: The classification model should also output a confidence score for each category, allowing for a threshold to be set for alerts.
Hand-off: Passes the video's classification result (e.g., "Urgent Crime", "People") and its original metadata (location, time) to the Alert Generation Agent.
 
Step 4: Alert Generation Agent
 
This agent is responsible for dispatching the appropriate alerts based on the video classification.
Action: Receives classification results and metadata from the Video Classification Agent.
Conditional Alerting:
If Classification is "People" or "Crowd":
Target: Sends an alert to relevant "People" contacts (e.g., community outreach teams, social services, neighborhood watch groups within the specified radius). The alert could include a link to the video, location, and time.
If Classification is "Urgent Crime":
Target: Generates an urgent alert to Police contacts within a one-mile radius of the incident location.
Content: The alert should be concise and contain critical information:
Type of crime (e.g., "Possible Robbery in Progress").
Exact incident location (GPS coordinates and address).
Timestamp of the incident.
A secure link to the video evidence.
Any other immediately apparent details (e.g., number of individuals, descriptions if discernible).
Logging: Logs all alerts sent, including recipient, type, and timestamp, for auditing and future reference.
User Notification: Potentially sends a confirmation to the user who uploaded the video, indicating its status and any actions taken.
 
Why Agentic AI?
 
This agent-based approach provides several benefits:
Modularity: Each step is a distinct agent, making the system easier to develop, test, and maintain.
Scalability: Agents can operate concurrently, allowing the system to handle a high volume of video uploads. Individual agents can be scaled independently based on their workload.
Robustness: If one agent encounters an issue, it's less likely to bring down the entire system. Error handling can be implemented within each agent.
Flexibility: New classification types or alert mechanisms can be added by simply creating or modifying specific agents without disrupting the entire pipeline.
Autonomy: Agents can operate with minimal human intervention once configured, providing a highly automated workflow for KrimeWatch.
